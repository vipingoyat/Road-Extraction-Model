# Satellite-Image-Road-Extraction

This project involves using computer vision techniques, specifically deep learning models, to extract roads from satellite images. The two main approaches being utilized are DeepLabv3+ with ResNet50 as the backbone and a UNet model.


The tech stack for this project includes:

OpenCV: For image processing tasks such as reading, resizing, and manipulating satellite images.

TensorFlow: Deep learning frameworks used for implementing and training the DeepLabv3+ and UNet models.

DeepLabv3+ with ResNet50: Pre-trained model for semantic segmentation.

UNet: Custom implementation or pre-trained model for image segmentation.

Python: The primary programming language for developing the project.

Various data manipulation and visualization libraries in Python, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

How to Run:

1. Run the app.py file
2. Then Upload the image and get the predicted image.
